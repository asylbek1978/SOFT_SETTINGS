Filter a Value
	With the pipe "|" character followed by a filter name, you can run a value through a filter before returning it.
	The name of the filter defines what the filter will do with the value.


	Return the variable firstname with upper case letters:
	<h1>Hello {{ firstname|upper }}, how are you?</h1>

Multiple Filters
	You can add more than one filter by adding pipe | characters followed by filter names:

	Return the first character of variable firstname, in lower case:
	<h1>Hello {{ firstname|first|lower }}, how are you?</h1>

The filter Tag
	The filter tag allows you to run a whole section of code through a filter, and return it according to the filter keyword(s).
	Example
	Return the variable firstname with upper case letters:
	{% filter upper %}
	  <h1>Hello everyone, how are you?</h1>
	{% endfilter %}
		HELLO EVERYONE, HOW ARE YOU?


	To add multiple filters, separate the keywords with the pipe | character:
	Example
	Separate filters with the pipe character:

	{% filter upper|linenumbers %}Hello!
	my name is
	Emil.
	What is your name?{% endfilter %}
		1. HELLO! 2. MY NAME IS 3. EMIL. 4. WHAT IS YOUR NAME?
