	DNF : Dandified Yum
	DNF (Dandified Yum) is a software package manager, successor of YUM (Yellow dog Updater Modified). It works with RPM** packages grouped in a local or remote repository (a directory for storing packages). For the most common commands, its usage is identical to that of yum. The "dnf" command allows the management of packages by comparing those installed on the system with those in the repositories defined on the server. It also automatically installs dependencies, if they are also present in the repositories. "dnf" is the manager used by many RedHat based distributions (RockyLinux, Fedora, CentOS, ...).
	The DNF manager relies on one or more configuration files to target the repositories containing the RPM packages. These files are located in /etc/yum.repos.d/ and must end with .repo in order to be used by DNF.
	Example:
		/etc/yum.repos.d/Rocky-BaseOS.repo

	//The dnf command allows you to install a package by specifying only the short name.
