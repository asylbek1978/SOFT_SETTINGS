You can copy the content of a folder "/source" to another existing folder "/dest" with the command

cp -a /source/. /dest/
	The "-a" option is an improved recursive option, that preserve all file attributes, and also preserve symlinks.
	The "." at end of the source path is a specific cp syntax that allow to copy all files and folders, included hidden ones.
	-a already implies --preserve=all, that is wider than -p = --preserve=mode,ownership,timestamps.
	examples
		cp -a /opt/alfresco-community/tomcat/webapps/alfresco/. /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/alfresco/
		cp -a /opt/alfresco-community/tomcat/webapps/alfresco.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/alfresco.war
		cp -a /opt/alfresco-community/tomcat/webapps/hello/. /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/hello/
