JSX = JavaScript + XML

code
	const heading = <h1 className="site-heading">Hello, React</h1>
no jsx
	const heading = React.createElement('h1', { className: 'site-heading' }, 'Hello, React!')


JSX is actually closer to JavaScript, not HTML, so there are a few key differences to note when writing it.

	'className' is used instead of 'class' for adding CSS classes, as 'class' is a reserved keyword in JavaScript.
	Properties and methods in JSX are camelCase - 'onclick' will become 'onClick'.
	Self-closing tags must end in a slash - e.g. '<img />'

JavaScript expressions can also be embedded inside JSX using curly braces, including variables, functions, and properties.
	const name = 'Tania'
	const heading = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>

JSX is easier to write and understand than creating and appending many elements in vanilla JavaScript, and is one of the reasons people love React so much.
